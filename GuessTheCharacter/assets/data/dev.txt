"Kishido" is a japanese term commonly tied up to the One Piece character, Sanji. It basically means a strong conviction or a way of life.

I created "Kishido" as a means for me to hone my skills on several facet of Game programming, particularly in the Android platform, while providing user quality games to play for FREE.

I guess that's probably my "Kishido".
